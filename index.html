      <h2>Living with my 2023 Nissan Frontier</h2>

      <p>I have put enough miles on my 2023 Nissan Frontier SV Midnight to know exactly what makes it great for a student life in East Lansing. First, the size is perfect: small enough to slide into a tighter campus lot, big enough to haul DIY furniture, recycling club supplies, and the occasional Craigslist find. The LED headlights and blacked out trim look clean, but what I appreciate most is how stress free the truck feels day to day. Visibility is solid, the ride is comfortable on pothole season roads, and the cabin tech is simple enough that I am not digging through menus at a stoplight.</p>
      <p>Real talk on costs: I track fuel and maintenance in a spreadsheet. My mix is mostly city with short highway hops to Lansing or Okemos. Even with that, the Frontier’s running costs have stayed predictable: oil change, tires rotated, done. When friends ask why not a crossover, it comes down to utility. A bed is a cheat code for student projects and weekend trips. I have hauled moving boxes, a used desk, and even a set of practice cones for intramurals. If you are considering a midsize truck, here is a quick, totally unscientific comparison from my notes.</p>

      <h3>Midsize Truck Comparison</h3>

      <h2>Behind the Bar: What I've learned at High Caliber</h2>

      <p>When I am not in class at MSU, you will often find me behind the bar at High Caliber in Okemos. Working as a bartender there has been one of the most unexpectedly useful experiences of my college years. For starters, before this job I never knew how to bartend so learning on the fly was definitely a challenge. The job is fast paced and customer oriented, which means I have learned how to think on my feet, multitask, and stay calm under pressure, skills that translate directly to group projects and deadlines in my information science courses.</p>
      <p>Every shift teaches me something new about communication. Whether it is reading a guests mood, coordinating with the kitchen, or timing drink orders during a rush, bartending is basically a real world UX test of service flow. The job has also sharpened my memory and organization; you have to remember regulars preferences, ingredient ratios, and special instructions quickly. And, like any good interface, the setup matters: a clean bar and clear labeling make the whole operation smoother. For a student balancing work, school, and hobbies, it has been a crash course in efficiency, hospitality, and people skills, all while meeting a huge cross section of the Lansing area community.</p>
