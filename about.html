      <p>Hi, Nolan Fish, an Information Science student at Michigan State University focusing on Media and Information. I am interested in creating websites and tools that people actually enjoy using, whether thats through better structure, clean typography, or accessible interactions.</p>
      <p>Outside of class, you can find me behind the bar at High Caliber, or playing basketball at the IM centers with my friends. My goal is to keep learning by doing, building small things that solve real problems and honing my communication and web design skills in every setting.</p>

      <h3>Things I Enjoy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning about web design</li>
        <li>Love playing intramural basketball with my friends.</li>
        <li>Going camping and off roading with my truck.</li>
      </ul>
